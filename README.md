# MATLAB Truss Analysis Toolbox 🚀

A comprehensive collection of MATLAB scripts for the finite element analysis of truss structures in both 2D and 3D. This toolbox is designed for educational and engineering applications, offering clear implementations, visualization, and modular code for easy adaptation.

## 📌 Overview

The **MATLAB Truss Analysis Toolbox** provides scripts to analyze truss structures using the finite element method (FEM). The repository is organized into two main sections:

- **2D Truss Analysis:** Contains scripts to analyze and visualize 2D truss systems.
- **3D Truss Analysis:** Contains scripts to analyze and visualize 3D truss systems.

Each section is modularized for ease of understanding, maintenance, and further development.

## ✨ Features

- **Dual Analysis Modes:** Dedicated folders for both 2D and 3D truss analysis.
- **FEM Implementation:** Calculate nodal displacements, element forces, stresses, strains, and stress utilization.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Generate 2D/3D plots to visualize the structure's behavior before and after deformation.
- **Modular Code:** Clean separation of main scripts and helper functions for easier scalability.
- **Educational Resource:** Detailed comments and output logs to aid learning and troubleshooting.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirhh-04/MATLAB-Truss-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Open in MATLAB:**

   Navigate to the cloned repository directory in MATLAB.

3. **Run the Main Scripts:**

   - For 2D analysis, open and run `truss2D.m` in the `2D` folder.
   - For 3D analysis, open and run `truss3D.m` in the `3D` folder.

## 🚀 Usage

To run the simulations, open MATLAB and follow these steps:

### 2D or 3D Simulation

1. Navigate to the `2D` or `3D` folder.
2. Open `truss2D.m` or `truss3D.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   truss2D or truss3D
   ```
4. The results will be displayed as plots and animations.

## 📊 Results

Upon running the analysis, you will receive:

- **Numerical Data:**  
  - Nodal displacements
  - Element forces and stresses
  - Strain and stress utilization percentages
